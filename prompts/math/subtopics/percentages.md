## QUESTION TYPES for Percentages (generate {{COUNT}} questions):

Create questions about percentage calculations, increases, decreases, and conversions.

### Types to Include:
1. **Finding a Percentage** - What is 25% of 80?
2. **Percentage of a Quantity** - Finding percent of a whole
3. **Percentage Increase/Decrease** - Price changes, population changes
4. **Reverse Percentages** - Original value before increase/decrease
5. **Comparing Percentages** - Which is the better deal?
6. **Percentage to Fraction/Decimal** - Converting between forms

### Context Variety:
- Shopping discounts and sales
- Test scores and grades
- Population and statistics
- Profit and loss
- Interest and savings

### Example Scenarios:
- "A jacket costs $80. It is reduced by 15%. What is the sale price?"
- "Jayden scored 42 out of 60 on a test. What percentage did he score?"
- "After a 20% increase, a price is $60. What was the original price?"
- "Which is the better deal: 30% off $50, or 25% off $55?"

### CRITICAL RULES:
1. Use common percentages: 10%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 50%, 75%
2. Ensure calculations result in sensible monetary amounts
3. For reverse percentage problems, make sure original values are whole numbers
4. Avoid percentages that result in awkward decimals
5. All monetary answers should be to 2 decimal places (or whole dollars)
