## Algebra & Patterns Question Guidelines (NSW Selective Math)

### Core Concepts
1. **Symbol Equations** - Shapes/symbols representing unknown numbers
2. **Visual Simultaneous Equations** - Stars/hearts/boxes with point values
3. **Number Patterns** - Finding rules, extending sequences, missing terms
4. **Algebraic Expressions** - Translating words to expressions, evaluating
5. **Perimeter with Unknowns** - Finding dimensions when shapes are added/removed

### Question Patterns
- "If square x 9 = 108 and triangle + square = 36, what is triangle?"
- "3 stars and 5 hearts = 27 points. 5 stars and 7 hearts = 41 points. What is 1 star + 1 heart?"
- "Pattern: 2, X, 0, Y, 6, Z. Each number is sum of previous three. What is Z?"
- "Shape X has perimeter 64cm. Adding a rectangle makes Shape Y with perimeter 82cm. Find the width."

### Difficulty Techniques
- Require solving multiple equations in sequence
- Use patterns with multiple operations (not just +n)
- Include patterns where the rule changes
- Require setting up equations from word problems
- Include irrelevant visual information

### Context Ideas
- Arcade games with point values
- Tile patterns in design
- Growing shape sequences
- Building with blocks
- Savings and spending patterns

### CRITICAL RULES
- Keep numbers manageable for mental math
- Ensure unique solutions
- Symbol equations should be solvable without algebra notation
- Patterns should be discoverable with careful analysis
