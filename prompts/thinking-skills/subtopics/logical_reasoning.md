## QUESTION TYPES for Logical Reasoning (generate {{COUNT}} questions):

Create constraint satisfaction and deduction puzzles. Use a MIX of these 12 types:

**ORDERING & ARRANGEMENT:**
1. **Sequence Ordering** - Clues about before/after/between relationships; determine order of people/items
2. **Position from Relational Data** - Table or clues showing relative positions (left/right, taller/shorter); deduce exact arrangement
3. **Circle Arrangement + Action Tracing** - People in a circle with relative positions, then trace a sequence of passes/actions

**SCHEDULING & TIME:**
4. **Timetable/Scheduling Constraints** - Multiple activities with time slots and rules; find valid schedules or conflicts
5. **Calendar/Day Constraints** - Events on specific days with rules about gaps, sequences, or exclusions

**POSSIBILITY & NECESSITY:**
6. **Must/Could Be True** - Given constraints, what MUST be true vs what COULD be true vs what's IMPOSSIBLE
7. **Necessary vs Sufficient Conditions** - Meeting a requirement doesn't guarantee outcome; distinguish "if" from "only if"

**DEDUCTION & INFERENCE:**
8. **Truth/Lie Puzzles** - Multiple people make statements; exactly one/some tell truth; determine facts
9. **Category Classification** - People/items belong to categories based on rules; deduce memberships
10. **Inference from Observations** - Partial observations about who did what/when; deduce the full picture

**OPTIMIZATION & STRATEGY:**
11. **Votes/Minimum Needed** - Threshold calculations (minimum votes to win, minimum items to guarantee outcome)
12. **Strategic Question Selection** - Given partial information, which single question would determine the complete answer?

**IMPORTANT:** Distribute questions across DIFFERENT types. Do NOT generate multiple questions of the same type unless necessary. Vary contexts (sports, school, games, travel, shopping, etc.).
