## Measurement Question Guidelines (NSW Selective Math)

### Core Concepts
1. **Time Calculations** - 12/24-hour conversion, elapsed time, crossing noon/midnight
2. **Time Zones** - Australian time zones, international flights
3. **Reading Scales** - Scales that don't start at zero, unmarked intervals
4. **Capacity/Volume** - mL and L, mixing liquids, container problems
5. **Unit Conversion** - mm/cm/m/km, g/kg, mL/L
6. **Ratios in Measurement** - Mixing, scaling, comparing quantities

### Question Patterns
- "A watch reads 1850. What time is it one quarter of an hour later in 12-hour format?"
- "Kylie leaves Las Vegas at 1300 on a 6-hour flight. Sydney is 17 hours ahead. What time does she arrive?"
- "The scale shows 850g with the jar. Empty jar is 330g. She needs 650g sauce. How much more?"
- "Mix 2 parts cordial to 5 parts water. For 350mL total, how much cordial?"

### Difficulty Techniques
- Cross midnight/noon in time calculations
- Include time zone changes with date changes
- Use scales with offset errors or non-zero starting points
- Combine units in one problem (require conversion)
- Include container weight vs contents

### Context Ideas
- Flight schedules (Australian airlines, airports)
- Cooking and recipes (Australian units)
- Science experiments
- Shopping (Australian products, $)
- Sports timing

### CRITICAL RULES
- Use metric units only (no imperial)
- Australian time zones: AEST, AWST, ACST
- Realistic contexts (Australian locations, products)
