## Data & Statistics Question Guidelines (NSW Selective Math)

### Core Concepts
1. **Mean (Average)** - Calculating and interpreting arithmetic mean
2. **Median, Mode, Range** - Finding middle value, most frequent, spread
3. **Interpreting Tables** - Reading and extracting data from tables
4. **Working Backwards** - Finding missing values given statistical measures

### Question Patterns
- "Test scores are 85, 92, 78, 88, 92. What is the mean score?"
- "Heights are 142, 138, 145, 138, 140. What is the median?"
- "The mean of 4 numbers is 15. Three are 12, 18, 14. What is the fourth?"
- "What score is needed on the sixth test to raise the average from 80 to 82?"

### Difficulty Techniques
- Require working backwards from mean to find missing value
- Include even number of values (median requires averaging)
- Data sets with multiple modes or no mode
- Combine mean and range in one problem
- Include outliers that affect the mean

### Distractor Design (Common Errors)
- Adding without dividing by count
- Not ordering data before finding median
- Forgetting to average two middle values
- Confusing mode with median

### Context Ideas
- Test scores and grades
- Sports statistics (cricket averages, game scores)
- Weather data (temperature, rainfall)
- Survey results (class preferences)
- Height/weight measurements

### CRITICAL RULES
- Keep data sets to 5-8 values for Year 6
- Use realistic numbers for the context
- Ensure calculations are manageable mentally
- Australian context (schools, sports, locations)
