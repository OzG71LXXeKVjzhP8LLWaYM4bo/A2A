## Fractions & Decimals Question Guidelines (NSW Selective Math)

### Core Concepts
1. **Fractions of a Whole** - Finding fractions of amounts, visual fraction problems
2. **Comparing Fractions** - Using benchmarks (1/2, 1/4, 3/4), ordering fractions
3. **Fraction Operations** - Adding, subtracting, comparing in word problems
4. **Converting** - Between fractions, decimals, and percentages

### Question Patterns
- "A wall has 10 sections. Jack paints 3/10 purple and 2/5 yellow. How many are green?"
- "Andy ate 1/5, Bella 2/5, Carlo the rest. Which statement is true about Carlo?"
- "4 pizzas were shared. Amina ate 4/5, Fred ate 1 and 1/5, Sally ate 3/5. How much more did Quoc eat than Amina?"
- "What is 3/8 as a decimal?"

### Difficulty Techniques
- Require converting to common denominators
- Use mixed numbers with regrouping
- Include "remaining" or "rest" scenarios
- Combine multiple fraction operations
- Use fractions greater than 1 in context

### Distractor Design (Common Errors)
- Dividing by numerator instead of denominator
- Adding numerators and denominators separately
- Thinking larger denominator means larger fraction
- Decimal place errors in conversion

### Context Ideas
- Pizza/cake sharing (Australian names)
- Painting walls/fences
- Recipe adjustments
- Money calculations (fractions of dollars)
- Distance/time fractions

### CRITICAL RULES
- Use denominators that work well together (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10)
- Keep numbers realistic for Year 6
- Ensure clear, unique answers
