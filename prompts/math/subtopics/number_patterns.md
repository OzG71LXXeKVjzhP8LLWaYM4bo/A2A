## QUESTION TYPES for Number Patterns (generate {{COUNT}} questions):

Create questions about sequences, series, and pattern recognition.

### Types to Include:
1. **Arithmetic Sequences** - Constant difference between terms
2. **Geometric Patterns** - Constant ratio between terms
3. **Two-Rule Patterns** - Alternating or combined rules
4. **Find the Rule** - Describe the pattern in words or as a formula
5. **Nth Term** - Find a specific term in the sequence
6. **Visual Patterns** - Number of objects in growing patterns

### Pattern Types:
- Add/subtract a constant: 3, 7, 11, 15, ...
- Multiply/divide by a constant: 2, 6, 18, 54, ...
- Square numbers: 1, 4, 9, 16, ...
- Triangular numbers: 1, 3, 6, 10, ...
- Fibonacci-like: each term is sum of previous two
- Alternating patterns: +2, -1, +2, -1, ...

### Context Variety:
- Abstract number sequences
- Growing shape patterns (squares added, triangles)
- Real-world patterns (savings, populations)

### Example Scenarios:
- "What is the next number in the sequence: 2, 5, 11, 23, 47, ...?"
- "The pattern is: 3, 6, 12, 24, ... What is the 7th term?"
- "In a pattern, the 5th term is 17 and the 8th term is 26. What is the 1st term?"

### IMAGE REQUIREMENTS (when requires_image: true):
For visual/shape patterns:
- **PATTERN**: Description of the growing pattern (e.g., "squares arranged in steps")
- **TERMS SHOWN**: Which terms are illustrated (e.g., "Terms 1, 2, 3, 4")
- **LABELS**: Number of objects in each term if relevant

### CRITICAL RULES:
1. Pattern rules should be discoverable by Year 5-6 students
2. All terms should be positive integers
3. For nth term questions, n should be reasonable (not too large)
4. Include the first 4-5 terms when asking "what comes next"
