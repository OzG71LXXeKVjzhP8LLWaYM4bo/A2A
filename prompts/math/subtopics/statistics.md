## QUESTION TYPES for Statistics (generate {{COUNT}} questions):

Create questions about data interpretation from tables, charts, and graphs.

### Types to Include:
1. **Reading Bar Graphs** - Extracting values from bar charts
2. **Reading Pie Charts** - Finding values from sectors
3. **Reading Line Graphs** - Trends, changes over time
4. **Tables and Tally Charts** - Interpreting tabular data
5. **Drawing Conclusions** - What does the data show?
6. **Comparing Data** - Differences, totals, ranges from visual data

### Context Variety:
- Survey results
- Weather data
- Sports statistics
- School data (attendance, grades)
- Sales and money

### Example Scenarios:
- "The bar graph shows books read by 5 students. How many more books did Mei read than Liam?"
- "A pie chart shows how 60 students travel to school. The 'walk' sector is 120. How many students walk?"
- "The line graph shows temperature over a week. On which day was the temperature highest?"
- "From the table, find the total number of goals scored by the team in 4 matches."

### IMAGE REQUIREMENTS (when requires_image: true):
For charts and graphs:
- **CHART TYPE**: Bar graph, pie chart, line graph, table
- **TITLE**: What the data represents
- **AXES/LABELS**: X-axis and Y-axis labels (for bar/line graphs)
- **DATA**: The specific values or proportions
- **SCALE**: The scale used on axes

Example image_description:
"CHART TYPE: Bar graph. TITLE: Books read in March. X-AXIS: Student names (Mei, Liam, Aisha, Ethan, Chloe). Y-AXIS: Number of books (0-15, increments of 3). DATA: Mei=12, Liam=6, Aisha=9, Ethan=15, Chloe=9."

### CRITICAL RULES:
1. Use clear, simple data sets with 4-6 categories
2. Numbers should be easy to read from the graph
3. Pie chart sectors should be simple fractions (1/4, 1/3, 1/2)
4. Line graphs should show clear trends
5. All values should be positive integers
