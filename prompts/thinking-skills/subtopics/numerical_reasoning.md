## QUESTION TYPES for Numerical Reasoning (generate {{COUNT}} questions):

Create multi-step word problems requiring calculations:

1. **Chain Conversions** - Multiple conversion rates between units; calculate total conversion

2. **Equal Groups with Partial Information** - Groups have same count but different values; given partial total, find missing total

3. **Overlapping Sets (Venn Diagrams)** - Categories that overlap; use inclusion-exclusion to find counts

4. **Scoring Systems** - Different zones/actions worth different points; deduce values from multiple examples

5. **Grid/Tiling Calculations** - Area divided into units; calculate positions, remainders, or patterns

Vary the numbers, contexts (money, tokens, points, items), and specific scenarios.
