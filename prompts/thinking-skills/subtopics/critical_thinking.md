## QUESTION TYPES for Critical Thinking (generate {{COUNT}} questions):

Create "strengthen/weaken the argument" questions:

**FORMAT**: Present an argument or claim, then ask:
"Which statement, if true, most **strengthens** the argument?"
OR
"Which statement, if true, most **weakens** the argument?"

**ARGUMENT CATEGORIES:**
- Environmental claims (conservation, sustainability choices)
- Causal claims (X causes Y)
- Policy recommendations (should do X because of Y)
- Historical/scientific interpretations

**KEY WEAKENING STRATEGIES:**
- Alternative explanation achieves same outcome
- Counter-example exists that disproves the pattern
- Cause and effect are reversed
- The proposed solution actually undermines the stated goal
- Hidden assumption is false

**KEY STRENGTHENING STRATEGIES:**
- Additional evidence supports the causal link
- Alternative explanations are ruled out
- The mechanism is explained
