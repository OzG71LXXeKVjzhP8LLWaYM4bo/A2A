## QUESTION TYPES for Averages (generate {{COUNT}} questions):

Create questions about mean, median, mode, and range calculations.

### Types to Include:
1. **Mean (Average)** - Finding the mean of a set of numbers
2. **Missing Value** - Finding a missing number given the average
3. **Effect on Average** - How adding/removing a number changes the average
4. **Weighted Averages** - Different weights or frequencies
5. **Median and Mode** - Finding middle value or most common value
6. **Range** - Finding the difference between highest and lowest

### Context Variety:
- Test scores and grades
- Sports statistics (runs, goals, times)
- Temperature readings
- Heights and weights
- Prices and quantities

### Example Scenarios:
- "Ethan's test scores are 78, 85, 92, 88. What score does he need on the 5th test for an average of 85?"
- "The average of 5 numbers is 12. When one number is removed, the average becomes 10. What number was removed?"
- "Find the median of: 15, 22, 18, 31, 22, 19, 22"

### CRITICAL RULES:
1. All numbers should be reasonable for the context
2. Answers should work out to whole numbers or simple decimals
3. For missing value problems, ensure the answer is positive and reasonable
