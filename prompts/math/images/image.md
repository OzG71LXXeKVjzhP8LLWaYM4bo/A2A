## CRITICAL LABELING RULES (MUST FOLLOW):

### Vertex Labeling:
1. **Label vertices in clockwise order** starting from top-left: A → B → C → D → ...
2. **NEVER repeat a label** - each letter appears exactly ONCE
3. **Place labels OUTSIDE the shape**, 2-3mm from the vertex
4. **Use CAPITAL letters only**: A, B, C, D, E, F...
5. **Before finalizing**: Count labels and verify each letter is unique

### Verification Checklist:
- [ ] Each vertex has exactly ONE label
- [ ] No label appears more than once
- [ ] Labels follow clockwise order
- [ ] All labels match the specifications above

## SIMPLICITY RULES (ESSENTIAL):

### Show ONLY:
- The main shape(s) described
- Vertex labels (A, B, C, etc.)
- Maximum 2-3 key dimensions (the most important ones)
- Shading ONLY if explicitly required

### Do NOT Show:
- **ANSWER CHOICES** - Never show A, B, C, D, E options or any answer values in the diagram
- Redundant dimension lines (if length is implied, don't show it)
- Right angle marks unless essential to the question
- Grid lines unless specifically requested
- Construction lines or helper lines
- Decorative elements, shadows, or 3D effects
- Any measurement not directly needed to solve the problem
- Numbers that are answer options (e.g., "12 cm²", "15 cm²")

### Visual Hierarchy:
1. **Primary**: The shape itself (bold, clear lines)
2. **Secondary**: Vertex labels (clear, readable)
3. **Tertiary**: Only essential dimensions

## STYLE REQUIREMENTS:

### Colors:
- Background: Pure white (#FFFFFF)
- Lines and text: Black (#000000)
- Shading (if needed): Light gray (#E0E0E0)
- Grid (if needed): Very light gray (#DDDDDD)

### Line Weights:
- Shape outlines: 2px solid black
- Dimension lines: 1px black with small arrows
- Grid lines: 0.5px light gray

### Typography:
- Vertex labels: Bold, 14-16pt
- Dimensions: Regular, 12pt
- Labels positioned clearly, never overlapping

## FINAL OUTPUT:
Generate a clean, professional, MINIMAL diagram suitable for a Year 6 selective schools exam.
The diagram should be immediately clear to a student - if it looks cluttered, remove elements.
