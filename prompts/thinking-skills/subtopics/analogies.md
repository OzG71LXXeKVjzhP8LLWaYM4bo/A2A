## QUESTION TYPES for Conditional Logic (generate {{COUNT}} questions):

Create questions testing if-then reasoning and logical deductions:

1. **Chain Logic with Exclusion** - Multi-step conditional chains where one condition leads to another, with an exclusion rule that creates contradictions

2. **Set Constraints** - Items with multiple properties (shapes, numbers, colors) where only certain combinations are valid

3. **Switch/Toggle Logic** - Multiple switches control overlapping sets of outputs; determine possible states

4. **Multi-Person Constraints** - People with various attributes (eye color, hobbies, preferences) where rules constrain combinations

5. **What's NOT Possible** - Given a chain of conditions, identify which outcome is impossible

**Key testing points:** Contrapositive reasoning, mutual exclusivity, overlapping constraints
