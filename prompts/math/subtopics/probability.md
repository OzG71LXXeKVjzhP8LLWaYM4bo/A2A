## QUESTION TYPES for Probability (generate {{COUNT}} questions):

Create questions about chance, likelihood, and probability calculations.

### Types to Include:
1. **Simple Probability** - P(event) = favourable outcomes / total outcomes
2. **Complement** - P(not A) = 1 - P(A)
3. **Combined Events** - Two independent events (dice, coins, spinners)
4. **Expected Value** - How many times would you expect...
5. **Comparing Probabilities** - Which event is more likely?
6. **Probability Words** - Certain, likely, unlikely, impossible

### Context Variety:
- Dice and number cubes
- Spinners with sections
- Cards from a deck (simplified)
- Marbles/balls in a bag
- Coins (fair and biased)

### Example Scenarios:
- "A bag contains 4 red, 3 blue, and 5 green marbles. What is the probability of picking a blue marble?"
- "A fair die is rolled twice. What is the probability of getting two 6s?"
- "A spinner has 8 equal sections numbered 1-8. What is the probability of spinning an even number?"
- "If the probability of rain is 3/5, what is the probability it won't rain?"

### IMAGE REQUIREMENTS (when requires_image: true):
For spinners or visual probability:
- **SHAPE**: Circle divided into sections
- **SECTIONS**: Number and size of sections (equal or unequal)
- **LABELS**: Numbers, colours, or symbols in each section
- **ARROW**: Spinner arrow position (if relevant)

### CRITICAL RULES:
1. Express probabilities as simplified fractions
2. Use small, manageable total outcomes (12, 20, 36 max)
3. For combined events, use independent events only
4. Avoid complex conditional probability
5. All probabilities must be between 0 and 1
