## Probability Question Guidelines (NSW Selective Math)

### Core Concepts
1. **Simple Probability** - Single events, expressing as fractions
2. **Combined Events** - AND/OR conditions, multiple outcomes
3. **Probability Representations** - Converting between fractions, decimals, percentages
4. **Experimental Probability** - Using trial results to estimate probability

### Question Patterns
- "A bag has 5 red, 3 blue, and 2 green marbles. What is the probability of picking blue?"
- "From a deck, what is the probability of drawing a red King?"
- "The probability of rain is 3/5. What is this as a percentage?"
- "A coin was flipped 50 times and landed heads 28 times. What is the experimental probability?"

### Difficulty Techniques
- Require counting total outcomes carefully
- Include combined conditions (AND, OR)
- Compare probabilities in different forms (fraction vs %)
- Include items that are NOT replaced
- Use multi-stage events (spinners, dice, cards)

### Distractor Design (Common Errors)
- Confusing number of outcomes with probability
- Adding probabilities when should multiply
- Not simplifying probability fractions
- Confusing experimental with theoretical

### Context Ideas
- Games (spinners, dice, cards)
- Lucky dips at school fetes
- Weather predictions
- Sports team selection
- Raffle tickets

### CRITICAL RULES
- Probabilities must be between 0 and 1
- Express as simplified fractions (or ask for decimal/%)
- Clearly define the sample space
- Australian context for names and scenarios
