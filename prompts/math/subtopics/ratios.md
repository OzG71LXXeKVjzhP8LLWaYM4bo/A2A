## QUESTION TYPES for Ratios (generate {{COUNT}} questions):

Create questions about ratio and proportion problems.

### Types to Include:
1. **Simplifying Ratios** - Express in simplest form
2. **Equivalent Ratios** - Finding missing values in equivalent ratios
3. **Sharing in a Ratio** - Dividing quantities according to ratios
4. **Comparing Ratios** - Which ratio is larger?
5. **Scaling** - Enlarging or reducing by a scale factor
6. **Ratio Word Problems** - Real-world ratio applications

### Context Variety:
- Recipes and cooking (scaling ingredients)
- Maps and scale drawings
- Mixing (paint, concrete, drinks)
- Sharing money or items
- Comparing quantities

### Example Scenarios:
- "Ethan and Jayden share 45 stickers in the ratio 4:5. How many stickers does each boy get?"
- "A recipe for 4 people uses 300g of flour. How much flour is needed for 6 people?"

### CRITICAL RULES:
1. Keep ratios simple (single-digit numbers when possible)
2. Ensure quantities divide evenly when sharing
3. All scale factors should give whole number or simple results
4. Express ratios with a colon (:) not as fractions
5. When finding total parts, ensure the answer is sensible
