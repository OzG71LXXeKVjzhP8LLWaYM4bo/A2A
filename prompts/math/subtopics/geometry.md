## Geometry Question Guidelines (NSW Selective Math)

### Shape Restrictions
Use ONLY these shapes:
- Rectangles and squares
- Right-angled triangles
- Composite L-shapes and T-shapes

### Question Types
1. **Area Calculations** - Finding area of single or combined shapes
2. **Perimeter Problems** - Finding perimeter with given/missing dimensions
3. **Composite Shapes** - Area/perimeter of joined rectangles
4. **Angle Problems** - Unknown angles using straight line (180°) or right angle (90°) rules
5. **Missing Dimensions** - Using area/perimeter to find unknown lengths

### Context Ideas
- Gardens and fencing
- Floor plans and rooms
- Paper folding/cutting
- Sports fields and courts
- Art and design projects

### Difficulty Techniques
- Include unnecessary measurements (red herrings)
- Require multiple calculation steps
- Use relationships between dimensions (e.g., "length is 3 times the width")
- Combine area and perimeter in one problem
- Include hidden/overlapping sections

### CRITICAL RULES
1. NO circles, parallelograms, trapezoids, or irregular polygons
2. All triangles must be right-angled
3. Label vertices clockwise (A, B, C, D)
4. Keep dimensions realistic for Year 6 calculations
