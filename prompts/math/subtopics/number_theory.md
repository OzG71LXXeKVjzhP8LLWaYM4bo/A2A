## Number Theory Question Guidelines (NSW Selective Math)

### Core Concepts
1. **Factors and Multiples** - Finding factors, LCM, HCF (GCD)
2. **Prime and Composite** - Identifying primes, prime factorization
3. **Divisibility Rules** - Rules for 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10
4. **Number Properties** - Square numbers, triangular numbers, odd/even rules

### Question Patterns
- "What are all the factors of 36?"
- "Find the lowest common multiple of 12 and 18."
- "Which numbers between 50 and 60 are prime?"
- "Is 2,847 divisible by 3?"
- "What digit in the ones place makes 47_ divisible by 6?"
- "What is the 8th triangular number?"

### Difficulty Techniques
- Require applying multiple divisibility rules
- Find missing digits for divisibility
- Use prime factorization to find LCM/HCF
- Apply odd/even rules to products and sums
- Include numbers that look prime but aren't (or vice versa)

### Distractor Design (Common Errors)
- Thinking 1 is prime
- Forgetting 2 is the only even prime
- Confusing factors with multiples
- Missing factor pairs
- Incorrect divisibility rule for 3 or 9

### Context Ideas
- Arranging students in rows/groups
- Sharing items equally
- Finding patterns in calendars
- Code breaking with number properties
- Tile patterns requiring LCM

### CRITICAL RULES
- 1 is NOT prime (it's neither prime nor composite)
- 2 is the ONLY even prime number
- Keep numbers reasonable for mental factoring
- Focus on numbers up to 100 for most problems
