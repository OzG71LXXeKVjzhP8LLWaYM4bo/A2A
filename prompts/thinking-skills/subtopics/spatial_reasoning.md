## QUESTION TYPES for Spatial Reasoning (generate {{COUNT}} questions):

Create visual/spatial puzzles (describe clearly for image generation):

1. **3D to 2D Views** - Object shown in 3D; identify view from specific angle (above, front, side)

2. **Mirror/Reflection Views** - Objects on transparent surface; show view from underneath (horizontal flip)

3. **Pattern Continuation with Cutting** - Tiled pattern where edge tiles must be cut; determine cut shape

4. **Net Folding** - Which 2D net folds into (or doesn't fold into) a given 3D shape


**IMAGE REQUIREMENTS:**
- Specify exact shapes, positions, orientations
- Use black/white/gray only (print-ready)
- For reflections: clearly note which elements flip
- For 3D: specify viewing angle precisely
