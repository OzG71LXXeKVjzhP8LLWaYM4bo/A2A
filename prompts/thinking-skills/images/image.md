## SIMPLICITY RULES (ESSENTIAL):

### Show ONLY:
- The pattern elements described (shapes, symbols, grids)
- Clear visual distinction between each element
- Question mark (?) in the answer position if applicable
- Arrows ONLY if showing a sequence direction

### Do NOT Show:
- **ANSWER CHOICES** - Never show A, B, C, D, E options or answer values in the diagram
- The answer to the question (show "?" in answer position instead)
- Decorative borders or frames
- Background patterns or textures
- Shadows, gradients, or 3D effects
- Extra labels or annotations
- Any elements not directly part of the pattern

### For Matrices/Grids:
- Use equal-sized cells with consistent spacing
- Thin black borders (1px) between cells
- Center each element within its cell
- The "?" cell should be clearly distinguishable

### For Sequences:
- Arrange elements in a clear horizontal or vertical line
- Use consistent spacing between elements
- Arrow at the end pointing to answer space (if needed)

## STYLE REQUIREMENTS:

### Colors (ONLY THESE):
- Background: Pure white (#FFFFFF)
- Lines/borders: Black (#000000)
- Filled shapes: Black (#000000) OR Gray (#CCCCCC) OR White
- Striped patterns: Black lines on white

### Shape Fills:
- SOLID BLACK: Completely filled shape
- SOLID GRAY: Filled with #CCCCCC
- WHITE/EMPTY: Just the outline
- STRIPED: Diagonal or horizontal lines

### Element Sizing:

- Consistent proportions throughout
- Leave adequate white space around elements

- Question mark (?): Large, bold, centered
- Any letters (A, B, C): Clear, readable, not decorative

## CRITICAL RULES:

1. **Consistency**: Every shape of the same type must look identical
2. **Clarity**: The pattern should be immediately visible to a student
3. **Minimalism**: If an element isn't needed to show the pattern, remove it
4. **Balance**: Equal spacing and sizing throughout
5. **ACCURACY** Can you check thoroughly all Spelling within the images are in British UK language and all images actually 'work' and 'make sense' or question to be valid

## FINAL OUTPUT:
Generate a clean, professional, MINIMAL diagram suitable for a Year 6 selective schools thinking skills exam.
The pattern should be immediately clear - if it looks busy, simplify it.
