## Number Operations Question Guidelines (NSW Selective Math)

### Core Concepts
1. **Place Value** - Understanding digit values in large numbers (millions, thousands)
2. **Order of Operations** - BODMAS/BIDMAS with multi-step expressions
3. **Rounding** - To nearest 10, 100, 1000, or any place value
4. **Working Backwards** - Finding starting values by reversing operations
5. **Multiplication/Division** - Multi-digit operations, patterns with large numbers
6. **Number Puzzles** - Magic squares, number grids

### Question Patterns
- "In the number 30,060, how many times larger is the value of 3 than 6?"
- "Which equation correctly shows this division with remainder?"
- "Alinta rounds to the nearest million, Tau to the nearest hundred thousand. What's the difference?"
- "Alan started with $X, gave some away, divided the rest. Working backwards, how much did he give?"

### Difficulty Techniques
- Include numbers with zeros as placeholders
- Require comparing values across different place values
- Use brackets and multiple operations
- Chain multiple operations in word problems
- Include irrelevant information

### Context Ideas
- Money calculations (Australian dollars)
- Population figures (Australian cities)
- Distance calculations (km between Australian locations)
- School fundraising scenarios
- Sports statistics (cricket, AFL)
