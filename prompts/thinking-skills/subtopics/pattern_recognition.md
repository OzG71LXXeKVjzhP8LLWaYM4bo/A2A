## QUESTION TYPES for Pattern Recognition (generate {{COUNT}} questions):

Create code-breaking and pattern questions:

1. **Position-Based Codes** - Secret messages where letter positions shift based on a rule

2. **Constraint-Based Word Ordering** - Arrange words/items so consecutive items don't share a property (letters, colors, etc.)

3. **Sequence Constraints** - Strings of symbols where certain consecutive patterns are forbidden

4. **Double-Sided/Multi-Property Items** - Cards or objects with different values on each side; deduce pairings

5. **Visual Number Properties** - Numbers that share properties when transformed (rotated, flipped, etc.)

6. **Symbol Substitution** - Letters replaced with symbols; decode a message

7. **Multi-Property Classification** - Objects classified by multiple independent properties; decode the system

Vary the specific rules, symbols, and contexts while maintaining these pattern structures.
