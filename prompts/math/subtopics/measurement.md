## QUESTION TYPES for Measurement (generate {{COUNT}} questions):

Create questions about length, mass, volume, time, and unit conversions.

### Types to Include:
1. **Length Conversions** - Converting between mm, cm, m, km
2. **Mass Conversions** - Converting between g and kg
3. **Volume/Capacity** - Converting between mL and L
4. **Time Calculations** - Duration, elapsed time, time zones
5. **Reading Scales** - Interpreting measurement instruments
6. **Compound Measures** - Speed (km/h), density

### Context Variety:
- Travel and distance
- Cooking and recipes
- Shopping and packaging
- Sports and athletics
- Science experiments

### Example Scenarios:
- "A recipe needs 2.5 kg of flour. Chloe has 1800 g. How much more flour does she need?"
- "A film starts at 2:45 PM and lasts 1 hour 52 minutes. What time does it end?"
- "Convert 3.75 km to metres"
- "A tap fills a bucket at 250 mL per second. How many litres in 2 minutes?"

### IMAGE REQUIREMENTS (when requires_image: true):
For scale/instrument reading questions:
- **INSTRUMENT**: Type of measuring device (ruler, scale, measuring jug)
- **SCALE**: The range and divisions shown
- **POINTER/LEVEL**: Where the measurement indicator points
- **LABELS**: Any relevant unit markings

### CRITICAL RULES:
1. Use metric units only (no imperial)
2. Ensure conversions work out to clean numbers
3. Time should use 12-hour (AM/PM) or 24-hour format consistently
4. For elapsed time, don't cross midnight unless specifically relevant
