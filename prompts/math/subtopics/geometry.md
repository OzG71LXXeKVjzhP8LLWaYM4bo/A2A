## QUESTION TYPES for Geometry (generate {{COUNT}} questions):

Create geometry questions using ONLY these shapes: rectangles, squares, and right-angled triangles.

### Types to Include:
1. **Area Calculations** - Finding area of rectangles, squares, right triangles
2. **Perimeter Problems** - Finding perimeter with given or missing dimensions
3. **Composite Shapes** - Area/perimeter of L-shapes, T-shapes, combined rectangles
4. **Angle Problems** - Finding unknown angles (straight line = 180, right angle = 90)
5. **Shaded Regions** - Finding area of shaded parts in composite figures

### Context Variety:
- Gardens and fencing
- Floor plans and rooms
- Paper folding/cutting
- Sports fields
- Art and design

### Example Scenarios:
- "A rectangle has length 12 cm and width 8 cm. A square of side 3 cm is cut from one corner. What is the remaining area?"
- "Find the perimeter of an L-shaped figure made from two rectangles"
- "In rectangle ABCD, angle ABE = 35. Find angle EBC."

### IMAGE REQUIREMENTS (when requires_image: true):
Use this structured format for image_description:
- **SHAPE**: The main geometric shape (Rectangle, Square, Triangle, L-shape)
- **VERTICES**: List in clockwise order from top-left (e.g., "A, B, C, D")
- **EXTRA POINTS**: Any additional labeled points and their position
- **KEY DIMENSIONS**: Only 2-3 essential measurements needed to solve the problem
- **SHADING**: What to shade/highlight (only if needed)

Example image_description:
"SHAPE: L-shaped figure. VERTICES: A (top-left), B (top-right of upper part), C, D, E, F. KEY DIMENSIONS: Top rectangle 8cm x 4cm, bottom extension 4cm x 3cm. SHADING: Entire figure outlined."

### CRITICAL GEOMETRY RULES:
1. NEVER use circles, parallelograms, trapezoids, hexagons, or irregular polygons
2. All triangles must be right-angled triangles
3. Label vertices in clockwise order: A, B, C, D...
4. Provide essential dimensions only - don't over-specify
5. Keep diagrams simple and uncluttered
